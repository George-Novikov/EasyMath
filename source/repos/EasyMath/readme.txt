This application suits for students or anyone needs to automate quadratic calulations.

Order is the following:
1. Enter numbers using your keyboard and the local "Enter" button
2. Once you've entered two numbers the program will ask you to select the formula
3. After selecting desired formula, press Enter button again
4. All results of a current session can be exported into "memory.txt" - you'll find it into the program folder
5. Press "Clear" button if yo–≥ got a typo and need to re-enter values

More formulas or calculation schemes might appear in future.

Cheers!
